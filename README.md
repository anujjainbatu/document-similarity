# Indian Cricketers Information Retrieval

This project demonstrates a simple information retrieval system using embeddings from the HuggingFace library and cosine similarity to find relevant information about Indian cricketers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12
- `langchain_huggingface`
- `python-dotenv`
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`

You can install the required packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Ensure you have the required packages installed.
3. Run the 

app.py

 script to retrieve information about Indian cricketers.

```sh
python app.py
```

## Code Explanation

The script in 

app.py

 performs the following steps:

1. Imports necessary libraries and modules.
2. Initializes the HuggingFace embeddings model.
3. Defines a list of documents containing information about Indian cricketers.
4. Defines a query to retrieve information about a specific cricketer.
5. Embeds the documents and the query using the HuggingFace embeddings model.
6. Computes the cosine similarity between the query embedding and the document embeddings.
7. Outputs the similarity scores.

## Example

Here is an example of how the script works:

```python
from langchain_huggingface import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np

embedding = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name='sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

documents = [
    "Sachin Tendulkar is a former Indian cricketer and captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest batsmen in the history of cricket.",
    "Virat Kohli is an Indian cricketer and the current captain of the India national team in all formats.",
    "MS Dhoni is a former Indian cricketer and captain, known for his calm demeanor and excellent leadership skills.",
    "Rohit Sharma is an Indian cricketer and the current vice-captain of the India national team in limited-overs formats.",
    "Kapil Dev is a former Indian cricketer and captain, who led India to its first World Cup victory in 1983."
]

query = "Tell me about Kapil."

doc_embeddings = embedding.embed_documents(documents)
query_embedding = embedding.embed_query(query)

scores = cosine_similarity([query_embedding], doc_embeddings)[0]
print(scores)
```
